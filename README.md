# Girls Who Code @ Columbia University
## Class 3: Intro to Data Science with Python

## Class 3 Syllabus

**What**: 8 classes introducing data science using python

**Where**: Zoom/Google Colab

**When**: Saturdays 10am-12:30pm; Spring 2022

**Who**: High school girls with a basic introduction to python

## **Course Learning Goals**
Broad Goals:
* Teach fundamentals of data science using python with an emphasis on its applications
* Show how data science is used to solve real world problems
* Show that data science is relevant to things students may be interested in
* Show other career avenues for students interested in CS

Skill-based Goals:
* Import, manipulate, and plot datasets
* Learn to analyze data, pose questions that can be answered by investigating relationships among variables in a dataset
* Use graphics to identify patterns in data
* Manipulate graphics to visualize data in the most effective way
* Connect patterns in data back to the real world
* Distinguish between different	types of data - time series, geographic, etc

## **Course Outline**
