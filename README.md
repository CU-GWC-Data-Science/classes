# Girls Who Code @ Columbia University
## **Class 3: Intro to Data Science with Python**

**What**: 8 classes introducing data science using python
**Where**: Zoom/Google Colab
**When**: Saturdays 10am-12:30pm; Spring 2022
**Who**: High school girls with a basic introduction to python

### **Course Learning Goals**
Broad Goals:
* Teach fundamentals of data science using python with an emphasis on its applications
* Show how data science is used to solve real world problems
* Show that data science is relevant to things students may be interested in
* Show other career avenues for students interested in CS
Skill-based Goals:
* Import, manipulate, and plot datasets
* Learn to analyze data, pose questions that can be answered by investigating relationships among variables in a dataset
* Use graphics to identify patterns in data
* Manipulate graphics to visualize data in the most effective way
* Connect patterns in data back to the real world
* Distinguish between different	types of data - time series, geographic, etc
